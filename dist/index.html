  <p id="description">Tesla, Inc. is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company based in Palo Alto,
    California. Tesla's
    current products include electric cars, battery energy storage from home to grid scale, solar panels and solar
    roof tiles, as well as other related products and services. Tesla is ranked as the world's best-selling plug-in
    and battery electric passenger car manufacturer, with a market share of 16% of the plug-in segment (which
    includes hybrids) and 23% of the battery electric (purely electric) segment 2020 sales. Through its subsidiary
    SolarCity, Tesla develops and is a major installer of solar photovoltaic systems in the United States. Tesla is
    also one of the largest global suppliers of battery energy storage systems, with 3 GWh of battery storage
    supplied in 2020. Tesla subsidiary Tesla Energy develops, builds, installs and sells solar energy generation systems, battery energy storage products, as well as other related products and services to residential, commercial and industrial customers. 

The company was founded after the merger of Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division with SolarCity, a solar energy company that Tesla acquired in 2016 at a cost of approximately $2.6 billion.[134]

Tesla Energy's generation products include solar panels (built by other companies for Tesla), Solar Roof, a solar shingle system, and the Tesla Solar Inverter. The company also builds the Tesla Powerwall, a home energy storage device and the Powerpack and Megapack, large-scale energy storage systems.[135][136][137]

In 2020, the company deployed solar energy systems capable of generating 205 megawatts (ranked third in U.S. residential solar installations) and deployed 3 gigawatt-hours â€‹of battery energy storage products.[138]</p>
